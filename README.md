## Description ##

This Python code was developed to calculate soot temperatures and volume fractions of co-flow diffusion flames using colour ratio pyrometry.

A detailed description can be found in the paper Dreyer et al., Applied Optics, 2019, [doi:10.1364/AO.58.002662](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.58.002662). Please cite this paper when using the code. A preprint of this paper is available [here](https://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/preprints/217/).

## How to use ##

The main file is:
```sh
Flame_pyrometry.py
```
Depending on the selections made, other functions are called. More detailed descriptions can be found in the code.
