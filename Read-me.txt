This python code was developed to calculate soot temperatures and volume fractions of co-flow diffusion flames using colour ratio pyrometry. 
Details of the code can be found in the CoMo c4e preprint 217 (https://como.cheng.cam.ac.uk/index.php?Page=Preprints&No=217) and in the submitted 
manuscript Dreyer et al., Applied Optics, 2019. Please cite these sources when using this code.

"Flame_pyrometry.py" is the main file. Depending on the selections made in "Flame_pyrometry.py", the other functions are called. More detailed descipions can be found in the python files.
